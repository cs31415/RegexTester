# Usage
![](regextester.jpg?raw=true)

1. Enter text to search in the `Text to search` box.
2. Enter regular expression in the `Pattern` box.
3. Select regular expression engine options using the check boxes.
4. Click on the `Search` button.
The search results are displayed in the bottom pane. Selecting a row in the
result table highlights the match text and match line.

A few niceties:
1. The last entered inputs are persisted and auto-populated when the program is
relaunched.

2. Hitting the `Enter` or `Return` key runs the search.

3. The View menu provides a way to wrap/unwrap text and show/hide non-alphanumeric
characters.
